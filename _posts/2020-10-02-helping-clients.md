I love helping clients build applications. Whether the application is facing the public or an internal tool, it feels great to make a difference. I know I am successful when my work allows people to focus on running their business. Making someone's job easier helps them achieve work-life balance, which as a father I can relate to. Also its pretty cool to see a business scale. When a business increases revenue, reduces expenses and is able to hire new employees to meet an increase in demand, it's nice to be a part of that.

I have to admit I like helping others for selfish reasons too. Building software products for others gives me an outlet to feed my perfectionist tendencies, thus scratching my mental itch. It's also pretty interesting to step into the client's world, learn more about their business, and see what things can be done to double-down on their strengths or overcome their pain-points. I am one of those nerds that can never stop learning or reading, so this nurtures my curiosity. Thirst for exploration and optimization allows me to implement solutions a client may not have thought of, which is a lot like solving a puzzle. Some times the business is too close to the problem to see which pieces are needed to complete the bigger picture.
