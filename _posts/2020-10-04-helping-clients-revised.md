There always feels like there's this giant moat between the technology the rest of the world is using and the technology you have access to. Payment portals, internal communication, functioning intranet... It's all possible, and large faceless corporations offer these services, but they are never tailored exactly to your needs. Either too limited or too complex, it feels like if they had just a 20% adjustment you would get 80% more benefit.  
<br>
That dream adjustment feels like just that, a dream. In reality, you are stuck with nursing weaknesses in lieu of concentrating on your strengths. You are stuck doing things like busy work, hunting down payments, and fighting with the current systems you already have. You are stuck avoiding new clients because you are dreading the overhead that comes with growth. Not only are you stuck, you only have a vague plan of what can and needs to be fixed, an exhausting topic you hardly want to breach after taking care of your day-in, day-out responsibilities.  
<br>
What you really want is to have a piece of that sweet, tech pie everyone else seems to be enjoying. You want tailor-crafted solutions that hugs your business snug yet comfortably, like an expensive suit. You want to do the tasks you want to do and let automation handle the tasks you don't. You want to grow your business smoothly, and not at the expense of your personal and family time. You need someone who can see the things that are out of your view and implement creative solutions that you, and your competitors, haven't thought of. This is 2020; where's the Rosie from _The Jetsons_ that you were promised?  
<br>
I want to be your Rosie. Let me rephrase that- I want to _implement_ your Rosie(s). How much easier your life gets determines my success, both professionally and personally; as a father I know how important work-life balance is and I would love to give that back to you. My applications will give you the keys to drive your business more efficiently and scale your competitive advantage.
